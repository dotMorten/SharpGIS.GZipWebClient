Available for direct install from NuGet: https://nuget.org/packages/SharpGIS.GZipWebClient

To use this code, explicitly use the SharpGIS.GZipWebClient class where you would normally use a WebClient instance. Ex:
   WebClient client = new SharpGIS.WebClient(); //Yes the type is still WebClient since that's what it inherits from :-)
   //continue with this WebClient as you used to

Or you can automatically opt in for all existing WebClients by adding the following code during application start up: 
   WebRequest.RegisterPrefix("http://", SharpGIS.WebRequestCreator.GZip);
   WebRequest.RegisterPrefix("https://", SharpGIS.WebRequestCreator.GZip);

This will change ALL web requests both those that uses WebClient and those that uses the lower-level HttpWebRequest, as well as any 3rd party library to start using compressed requests. Please test thoroughly - I've seen some issues with a few 3rd party libraries that doesn't work well with a different HttpWebRequest object, but for the most part this just works.
